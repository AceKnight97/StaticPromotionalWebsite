Prepare for the next review.

I. Expecting Salary: 18 Millions VND.

II. Reasons:
  1. It's the standard price compared to the 1.5 year-experience IT job in HCM city.
  2. I believe my abilities and work experiences can handle the project on my own.
  3. I've worked in this company for 2 years, I understand this company well enough to work smoothly.
  
III. New responsibility I want to take:
  1. The company is having more and more freshers or newbies. I can guide new people, sharing what I've learnt.
    More work will be done.
  2. If I have more responsibility, I'll work harder and faster.

IV. What you may think: 
  1. It's a big distance compared to my current salary (12 millions VND).
  2. You may doubt my abilities and work experiences, in the other way, what I can handle.
  3. The company is small, and can not pay much for the employee.
  4. I am not worth that salary.

V. My response to you:
  1. I think it is not a problem. I think I've got so little from the beginning.
    When the salary tells the abilities and work experiences, if you want to pay me low, that means you don't want me to work hard.
    I deal the price as the market price, the standard price that the other companies can pay for their employees.
  2. About my abilities and work experiences, what I can handle. 
    I just want to say: everything you see I've done is just the minimum that I really have done. You have to admit that you can not see or know exactly what I've done all the time.
  3. I don't think the company is still a small company. It's survived for many years, it has a big office and gonna to have another soon.
    The company is getting bigger and bigger, telling me that it is still a small one is just an excuse. 
  4. I'll prove I am, by this way or another.
  
VI. Feelings and thinkings:
  1. I am the first one to handle all the others's bugs (Back-end developer, Business Analysis, Designer).
  2. I am the first one to be responsible for any bug that occurs.
  3. I think my salary is so low that even a newbie's salary is higher than mine.
    Our company doesn't reveal people's salary, so no one can prove that I am right or wrong. 
  4. The work has some unsuitable things: 
    a. Quality Controller can log bugs for Front-end developers.
  How about Back-end developer, Business Analysis and UI Designer? So unfair!
    b. The time-line is fixed, it has no meaning except giving the stress for front-end developers.
  Back-end can be late releasing the APIs, Business Analysis, Designer can change things that make the front-end developer have to work more and even overtime and no one cares about it.
  People just care about how many bugs that the front-end developer has made and does the front-end developer release the product on time or not.
    c. When I talked about the overtime dealing, leaders didn't respond the way I think they should.
